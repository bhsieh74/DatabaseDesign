## Professor Amos Bloomberg's Question Board

 This app was designed to be a mock version of our Slack channel. We have over a hundred students in our class. Therefore, when students have questions that come up in class our during our readings, it might be difficult for Professor Bloomberg or Arun to cater to each one of us. As a result, many of us result to using Slack in order to ask our questions. However, I feel as if Professor Bloomberg or Arun answering questions through Slack is not always the best way to answer a question. Sometimes, a question needs verbal communication to be answered with clarity. As a result, this web app is perfect for people asking their questions and for Professor Bloomberg to take time in class to go over the questions. Then, once he has gone over them, he can simply delete them all and have a clean slate for next class. I tried to keep the layout simple and easy to understand.
